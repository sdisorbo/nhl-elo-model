nhl_elo_model: This is a script to scrape nhl play by play data for a given season and run an elo model to the point of progress during the given season. It cleans the data, 
preprocesses each NHL team's rolling metrics to adjust the initial ratings for each team, and then runs a nested for loop on each game to adjust the ratings on a game-by-game basis. 
This runs in O(nlogn) time. 

playoff_simulator: This is a script to run after getting a final dataframe from the nhl_elo_model script--you can input the 16 playoff teams for the given season and the script will
simulate the playoffs 10,000 times and find each teams' probability of making each round based on their elo rating.
